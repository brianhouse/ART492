# Artist Talks

What is an artist talk? It's any time you get a chance to present yourself and your work. It could be open to the public at a college, a gallery, or a conference, it could be as part of an interview for a job or graduate program, or it could be for an individual curator. In all these situations, you need to be prepared to present what you're all about in a straightforward and articulate way.

### Length
A typical invited artist talk is 30–40 minutes, a conference artist talk is about 20, and for an interview or meeting with a curator you'll have at most 10–15 to say what you need to say. For this assignment, we will do strict **maximum 10-minute talks**.

### Tech
Get used to having a two-screen setup / extended display so that you're looking at your notes on your computer while the audience sees your slide. Apple's Keynote is the best presentation software, PowerPoint is clunky but fine, Google Slides is passable. That said, you should use what you're comfortable with. For this assignment, you will be plugging your computer into the screen in Fields 207.

### Text vs image
**Use presenter notes**. Unlike other types of presentations, what you say does not have to be written on the slide (and in most cases probably shouldn't be). You don't want your audience reading text, you want them listening to you and looking closely at your work—and **your images should be high quality and look great**. But you still have to plan out what you're going to say, whether that is by fully writing it out or just having bullet points. If you do use text, **use only one font**.

### Basic template

You don't have to follow the template below, but I'd recommend it. Your work may be experimental, but your presentation should not be, and this flow is more or less what will be expected.

#### Slide 1: Title

The first slide is your title slide. It needs to have your full name on it, and possibly your social media handles. When you start presenting, you should say hi to everyone and thank your host. You might mention your connection to wherever you're presenting (ie, say "It's so great to be back at Lewis & Clark presenting my work" when we have you speak next year).

#### Slide 2: Bio

After a title slide, your first slide is your bio, which you've [already written](words.md). In this case, you're going to be talking in the first person, so you can loosen it up a little bit. You do not have to talk about past exhibitions or awards. But you do want to get across who you are, where you're coming from and what your training is, and the central theme of your practice. What image goes here? How about a photo of you working in your studio, a work in progress, or a location that is relevant to your story, or, as a last resort, just a photo of yourself.

#### Slides 3–5: Strongest work
Apart from the bio, an artist talk is not your life story, and it does not proceed in chronological order (I've seen _so many_ talks where the earliest/worst work comes first and takes up a lot of time, while the current/best work is last and is rushed). When you begin talking about your work, start with your strongest piece (likely from the Hoffman exhibition?).

Show an overall image, a few detail shots, and an exhibition photo (if you have it). If you have a video, play only a minute at most.

What are you talking about here? It's your [exhibition statement](words.md), rephrased in a more conversational way.

#### Slides 6–10: Trajectory

In the middle of your presentation, you have some flexibility. Ideally, you will show two or three more of your best work that show how you arrived at your current work. This establishes a trajectory for how you're working as an artist. This is where you talk about materials, what your process is all about, and how you have evolved. Succinctly.

#### Slide 11: Current / future work

What is the exciting thing that you're doing now in the studio? Show some experiments or hints of what you're doing, don't give it all away. If you're not actually working on anything, don't say that, just talk about what you're thinking about working on and show some inspirational images.

Though not overtly phrased as such, this is a pitch to whomever you are talking to to engage in your work. If it's a curator, they want to know what you're working on, what's coming next, and how they might work with you. If it's a general audience, this is why they're going to follow you on Instagram or join your mailing list.


#### Slide 12: Thank you

Your last slide should say "Thank you" (as should you) and include your web address, social media, and email.
