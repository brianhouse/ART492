# Artists' Words

As an artist, you will be continually asked to present yourself in writing. You'll do this for exhibitions, but perhaps more importantly, you'll do it for applications, whether they are for residencies, grants, or graduate programs. You'll also do it for yourself, as you continually refine your identity as an artist, and for your website and social media accounts through which you present yourself publicly.

This can be a real pain. However, there are just a handful of standard formats for which you will be repeatedly asked, and each of these formats is highly formulaic. While on some level writing them is a creative writing exercise, it is not the place for unbridled creative expression—save that for the art. However, it is a matter of crafting a story to which all of these paragraphs and documents will speak.


## Bio

The artist bio should be 100–200 words. It is absolutely not your life story, and it should not describe your history. Instead, these are the things that are appropriate to include:

- the medium you work in
- notable materials or techniques that you use
- the themes you address
- your exhibition highlights + awards
- any press you have received
- your education + institutional affiliations
- current project (optional)
- identity, such where you are based, nationality, heritage, gender, etc if it is relevant to your practice (optional)

These can come in various orders, but a basic (fictional) template is like this:

> Merriweather Lewis is a fiber artist based in Portland, OR [medium + identity]. His work deals with the material legacy of colonialism in the Pacific Northwest and investigates equitable modes of exchange in a post-capitalist future [themes].  He incorporates materials endemic to the region into his large-scale installations, such as mushrooms, as well as byproducts of Portand's industrial production [technique + materials]. Lewis's work has been exhibited at the Hoffman Gallery, Congress Yard Projects, and the DIY Punk House [exhibition highlights], and it has been featured in the Pioneer Log [press]. He holds a BA in Art from Lewis & Clark College [education] and will be an artist-in-residence at Headlands Center for the Arts in 2023 [awards].

Awkwardly, this is written in the third-person, with the conceit that someone else has written it for you. While in some contexts this is beginning to change, stick with this style for now.

Resist the temptation to go all out with the artspeak when it comes to describing your themes. It should be concise and understandable.

Finally, don't worry if your bio is a little scant for now—you're just at the beginning of your career. Do what you can to pad it so that these elements are included in some way. If you need another show, make a group show with your friends in a DIY space. As you develop, you will replace elements of the bio with more prestigious references.

#### Examples

Look at these bios, and identify how they incorporate the different elements discussed above. Even better, find more examples of artists you like and want to emulate, and see how you might apply their presentational strategies to your own practice.


**Alejandra Arias Sevilla**
> Alejandra Arias Sevilla is an interdisciplinary artist and printer based in Portland, Oregon. She investigates semantics, familiar spaces, and personal history to reflect and analyze the language that knits her selfhood. These are rooted in the storytelling of her grandmothers, her childhood in mexico, and the complexities of the color blue. Her work has been shown with Nat Turner Project, Black Fish Gallery, and Converge 45. She earned her degree at Pacific Northwest College of Art. She is the 2021 awardee of the Undergrowth Educational Print Fund at Mullowney Printing and the Stelo Letterpress Residency.

**Cara Tomlinson**
>Cara Tomlinson (b.San Francisco, USA) is an American abstract painter.  She works in painting and drawing, video and sculpture. Tomlinson’s work explores tensions between simplicity and complexity, order and entropy, and inside and outside. Her recent paintings present bodies as verbs and processes, exploring heredity, vision, metabolism, waste and sedimentation. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and supported by numerous grants and residency awards including: the Ucross Foundation, Millay Colony for the Arts, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and the Willapa Bay Artist Residency, Ford Family Foundation Grant, Individual Artist Fellowship Grant from the Oregon Arts Commission and two Professional Development Grants from the Portland Regional Arts Council and Oregon Arts Commission. She is currently an Associate Professor and head of Painting at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.

**Gianine Tabja**
>Gianine Tabja is a Peruvian visual artist whose work focuses on the relationships between time, displacement, and urban and industrial interventions. She holds a Bachelor in Fine Arts with a major in Painting from the PUCP and graduated with honors from the Glasgow School of Art where she obtained her Master of Letters in Fine Art Practice.

Gianine is a founding member of FIBRA Collective with whom she won the award for visual arts production from the Ministry of Culture of Peru. She lives and works in Lima.

**Sameer Farooq**
> Sameer Farooq is a Canadian artist of Pakistani and Ugandan Indian descent. His interdisciplinary practice investigates tactics of representation and enlists the tools of sculpture, installation, photography, documentary filmmaking, writing and the methods of anthropology to explore various forms of collecting, interpreting, and display. The result is often a collaborative work which counterbalances how dominant institutions speak about our lives: a counter-archive, new additions to a museum collection, or a buried history made visible. With exhibitions at institutions around the world including the Aga Khan Museum (Toronto), the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto), The British Library (London), the Institute of Islamic Culture (Paris), Vicki Myhren Gallery (Denver), the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver), Maquis Projects, (Izmir), Trankat (Tétouan, Morocco), Sol Koffler Gallery (Providence), Artellewa (Cairo), and Sanat Limani (Istanbul), Farooq received several awards from The Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, and the Europe Media Fund, as well the President’s Scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design. Reviews and essays dedicated to his work have been included in C Magazine, The Washington Post, BBC Culture, Hyperallergic, Artnet, The Huffington Post, Canadian Art, and others.
