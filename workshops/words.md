# Artists' Words

As an artist, you will be continually asked to present yourself in writing. You'll do this for exhibitions, but perhaps more importantly, you'll do it for applications, whether they are for residencies, grants, or graduate programs. You'll also do it for yourself, as you continually refine your identity as an artist, and for your website and social media accounts through which you present yourself publicly.

This can be a real pain. However, there are just a handful of standard documents for which you will be repeatedly asked, and many of these formats are highly formulaic. While on some level writing them is a creative exercise, it is not the place for unbridled creative expression—save that for the art. It is, however, a matter of crafting a story to which all of this writing will speak and which will hopefully be understood by the curator or admissions person who is reading it.

## Overview

These are the materials:

- Artist statement (1 page): a general statement about your artistic interests and the nature of your work

- Exhibition statement (150–300 words): a statement specific to a body of work (one or more pieces) in an exhibition that describes the overall concept

- Artwork descriptions (100–200 words): statements that are each about one specific piece

- Bio (100–200 words): your professional identity that includes a (very short) statement of the themes of your work

- Artist CV: a list of your professional accomplishments

- [Artist talk](artist_talks.md)

Thinking about all these things together is key to crafting a coherent professional identity.

One key point of clarification is the difference between an artist statement and an exhibition statement. An exhibition statement is often called an artist statement. However, if in an application to graduate school, for example, you are asked for an artist statement, this will be a general statement about your practice that is not tied to any particular body of work. An exhibition statement, on the other hand, pertains to a specific exhibition. Can these two things be the same thing? Maybe. But they serve two different purposes, and you may want to tailor that accordingly.

Additionally, depending on the nature of what you make, you may need a description of a single artwork, which should be more specific than an exhibition description. So in terms of most conceptual to most concrete, we have the following:

Artist statement > exhibition statement > artwork description

Furthermore, your bio will include something that sums up your practice in just a sentence or two (or even just a handful of words). This is as general as the artist statement, but in just a fraction of the space!

The best way to approach this is to begin with your artist statement and subsequently distill things down as needed. And remember—you will constantly be updating and refining all of this writing.

## Artist Statement

You may have already written an artist statement in 491. For our purposes in this course, remember that it is a 1-page document that remains general—it may talk about your materials, but probably not about what is accomplished by any specific piece of work. Its purpose is to give the reader the context for understanding where you are coming from as an artist.

- [Creative Independent: How to Write an Artist Statement](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-write-an-artist-statement/
)

In the second link, the author gives great overall advice, but then notes that an artist statement should be 100–300 words. 300 words is one page and is appropriate for an application, but 100 words is far too short for that purpose. That sounds more like an...


## Exhibition Statement

The exhibition statement (150–300 words) is very similar to the artist statement. However, in this case you are being asked to contextualize just the work that is in a particular exhibition. In addition, **the exhibition statement should make clear the one big idea that you are addressing in the work**. If someone sees the show, you want them to be able to describe your work to a friend in a succinct and compelling way. This is your chance to seed that conversation.

You may produce an exhibition statement for a group of artworks even if you're not yet exhibiting it—the statement can serve as a means of contextualizing a body of work within your larger practice.

To write this, start with your artist statement, and then tighten it up—remove the things that you're not addressing in your senior work. Get more specific about your methodology and materials. And zero-in on that one big idea that this particular body of work is about.

Some examples of exhibition statements can be seen on the website for the previous senior exhibition at the Hoffman: [Blissters](https://www.blissters.art)


## Work Descriptions

For painters and photographers that more often produce groups of artworks, an exhibition statement can serve to describe a body of work in your online or print portfolio. However, more conceptual or project-based work may require individual descriptions to let the reader know what is going on. Ideally, this should be no more than a paragraph introducing the work—you can think of it like an extended title.

Examples:

Liat Berdugo, _Internet Aerobics_ (2018)
>
>Put on your sweatband and come learn some new moves as part of _Internet Aerobics_. After all, everyday that we go online, we send packets of information across internet superhighways through layers of infrastructure: wifi networks, routers, data centers, internet cables, and more. Why not embody this infrastructure ourselves?


Brian House and Sue Huang, _Oh Dear Me_ (2016)

>A brass band is distributed along a path winding through the post-industrial Blackness area of Dundee, Scotland. When participants type a message at computer consoles on either end, their words are encoded via rearranged fragments of the “Jute Mill Song,” a protest song written in 1920 by Dundee mill worker Mary Brooksbank. The musicians subsequently pass the music to one another by ear until the message is decoded on the opposite terminal. Along the way, the melodies reverberate in the urban spaces associated with Dundee’s industrial past and connect historical textile production with the hidden labor of contemporary computation.



## Bio

The artist bio should be 100–200 words. It is absolutely not your life story, and it should not describe your history. Instead, these are the things that are appropriate to include:

- the medium you work in
- notable materials or techniques that you use
- the themes you address
- your exhibition highlights + awards
- any press you have received
- your education + institutional affiliations
- current project (optional)
- identity, such where you are based, nationality, heritage, gender, etc if it is relevant to your practice (optional)

These can come in various orders, but a basic (fictional) template is like this:

> Merriweather Lewis is a fiber artist based in Portland, OR [medium + identity]. His work deals with the material legacy of colonialism in the Pacific Northwest and investigates equitable modes of exchange in a post-capitalist future [themes].  He incorporates materials endemic to the region into his large-scale installations, such as mushrooms, as well as byproducts of Portand's industrial production [technique + materials]. Lewis's work has been exhibited at the Hoffman Gallery, Congress Yard Projects, and the DIY Punk House [exhibition highlights], and it has been featured in the Pioneer Log [press]. He holds a BA in Art from Lewis & Clark College [education] and will be an artist-in-residence at Headlands Center for the Arts in 2023 [awards].

Awkwardly, this is written in the third-person, with the conceit that someone else has written it for you. While in some contexts this is beginning to change, stick with this style for now.

Resist the temptation to go all out with the artspeak when it comes to describing your themes. It should be concise and understandable. In essence, it is a one or two sentence distillation of your artist statement.

Finally, don't worry if your bio is a little scant for now—you're just at the beginning of your career. Do what you can to pad it so that these elements are included in some way. If you need another show, make a group show with your friends in a DIY space. As you develop, you will replace elements of the bio with more prestigious references.

#### Examples

Look at these bios, and identify how they incorporate the different elements discussed above. Even better, find more examples of artists you like and want to emulate, and see how you might apply their presentational strategies to your own practice.


Alejandra Arias Sevilla
> Alejandra Arias Sevilla is an interdisciplinary artist and printer based in Portland, Oregon. She investigates semantics, familiar spaces, and personal history to reflect and analyze the language that knits her selfhood. These are rooted in the storytelling of her grandmothers, her childhood in mexico, and the complexities of the color blue. Her work has been shown with Nat Turner Project, Black Fish Gallery, and Converge 45. She earned her degree at Pacific Northwest College of Art. She is the 2021 awardee of the Undergrowth Educational Print Fund at Mullowney Printing and the Stelo Letterpress Residency.

Cara Tomlinson
>Cara Tomlinson (b.San Francisco, USA) is an American abstract painter.  She works in painting and drawing, video and sculpture. Tomlinson’s work explores tensions between simplicity and complexity, order and entropy, and inside and outside. Her recent paintings present bodies as verbs and processes, exploring heredity, vision, metabolism, waste and sedimentation. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and supported by numerous grants and residency awards including: the Ucross Foundation, Millay Colony for the Arts, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and the Willapa Bay Artist Residency, Ford Family Foundation Grant, Individual Artist Fellowship Grant from the Oregon Arts Commission and two Professional Development Grants from the Portland Regional Arts Council and Oregon Arts Commission. She is currently an Associate Professor and head of Painting at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.

Gianine Tabja
>Gianine Tabja is a Peruvian visual artist whose work focuses on the relationships between time, displacement, and urban and industrial interventions. She holds a Bachelor in Fine Arts with a major in Painting from the PUCP and graduated with honors from the Glasgow School of Art where she obtained her Master of Letters in Fine Art Practice. Tabja has been selected to participate in residences including Hawapi in Cajamarca, Localities III in Brussels, and RAT in Mexico City. She has had two solo shows: “Unidad I, el Paraíso” at Cecilia González Gallery and “Levedad e Identidad,” at Ricardo Palma Cultural Center. Tabja is a founding member of FIBRA Collective with whom she won the award for visual arts production from the Ministry of Culture of Peru. She lives and works in Lima.

Sameer Farooq
> Sameer Farooq is a Canadian artist of Pakistani and Ugandan Indian descent. His interdisciplinary practice investigates tactics of representation and enlists the tools of sculpture, installation, photography, documentary filmmaking, writing and the methods of anthropology to explore various forms of collecting, interpreting, and display. The result is often a collaborative work which counterbalances how dominant institutions speak about our lives: a counter-archive, new additions to a museum collection, or a buried history made visible. With exhibitions at institutions around the world including the Aga Khan Museum (Toronto), the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto), The British Library (London), the Institute of Islamic Culture (Paris), Vicki Myhren Gallery (Denver), the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver), Maquis Projects, (Izmir), Trankat (Tétouan, Morocco), Sol Koffler Gallery (Providence), Artellewa (Cairo), and Sanat Limani (Istanbul), Farooq received several awards from The Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, and the Europe Media Fund, as well the President’s Scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design. Reviews and essays dedicated to his work have been included in C Magazine, The Washington Post, BBC Culture, Hyperallergic, Artnet, The Huffington Post, Canadian Art, and others.

## CV

While you absolutely need to make a résumé to get jobs, internships, artist assistant positions, and the like, an artist CV is not a résumé. It pertains only to your accomplishments as an artist. In fact, providing a résumé may undermine the story you are telling about yourself if it includes unrelated experience.

Here is what is included in a CV:

- Contact Info
- Portfolio Link
- Education
- Solo Shows (exhibtions, screenings, or performances)
- Group Shows
- Grants, Awards, Fellowships, Residencies
- Publications (things you wrote)
- Bibliography (things other people have written about you)
- Invited Talks and Presentations (wherever you have talked about your work)
