# Sale and Insurance Values

## Pricing Work

Let’s start with two main assumptions:

1. Your work has value, and you deserve to be paid for it.
2. Someone out there will like this piece, want to own it, and be willing to pay the reasonable price you set.

Now, what does “reasonable” mean?
1. Give yourself a fair hourly wage.
2. Add to that the cost of materials you used and other expenses.
3. Double it.

This is a start. As an artist at the beginning of your career, your work doesn't have much market value. But this approach to setting a minimum guarantees that you'll always be paid for your labor at a rate you think is fair.

If a gallery chooses to sell your work, you will typically split the sale 50–50. They won't allow you to sell work on the side for a lower amount. Doubling your price now protects you if a gallery decides to sell the work and keep the prices the same.

At this point, if you're pricing a piece above $1000, you may be overvaluing your labor. Collectors that buy your work when you are first starting out are (probably) doing so because they think you have promise—your work will be worth more in future. Pricing too high undermines that idea as it makes the work less accessible for people to buy and more of a risk for people that do.

What makes a work worth more? Experience and exposure and everything you'll do after graduating.

Do you have to sell your work? No. There are many conceptual and practical reasons why you may not want to, in particular:
1. Attachment to keeping the work yourself.
2. Aversion to participating in a system of speculative finance.

It used to be that selling work was the sole marker of an artist's success. That is no longer necessarily the case. And, for that matter, you may choose to set your prices arbitrarily according to your own criteria.

## Insurance Value

This is simply the cost for you to replace the work. Rather than pricing, which is subject to interpretation, strategy, and feeling, this should just be labor + materials. If you follow the rubric above, this would be half the sale price.
