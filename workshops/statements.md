All of this tells a story
and you are constantly updating that story (and yourself)




Artist bio (150–300 words), three paragraphs
Artist statement (applications) (1 page)
Work description (website / portfolio) -- can describe a single art piece or a body of work  (150–300 words)

/

Exhibition statement is a synthesis (150–300 words)



Work in small groups



these descriptions always evolve for me, and they are symbiotic to some extent with the work. it's ok to constantly edit.



critique for:

- no bullshit
