# Websites

Website Best Practices (from Creative Capital): Be sure your site meets the following criteria:

- Equally functional and beautiful, erring toward functionality, while providing quality representation of your work.
- Smart phone and/or tablet accessible. Mobile optimization is increasingly important these days.
- Optimized for search engines. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) ensures that your site and images are all properly tagged.
- Loads quickly.
- Offers an easy way to stay connected, either though a mailing list or other media feed. Also allow users to unsubscribe.
- Update regularly, at least every 6 months so people know you’re still active.
- Keep a professional tone; avoid banner advertising and posting pictures of your vacation. Remember that curators and producers will see your site. Don’t post anything you wouldn’t want them to see.
