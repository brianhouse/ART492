# Instagram

Being an artist, especially a young artist, for better or for worse there's a conflation that happens between your personal social life and your professional life. This is where social media come in.

There's only one platform that matters at the moment when it comes to studio art, and that is Instagram. If someone becomes aware of you or your work and wants to know more, that's where they're going to go.

This is the scenario: at a gallery opening or dinner or a conference you meet someone, pull out your phones, and follow each other (it's less committal than a phone number). Afterwards, they're going to look at your profile, or at least they'll see content that you post. So what does your account need to accomplish?

#### Have a persona
- Be legible in the header and link to your website, upcoming shows, and institutional affiliations
- Signal your values, particularly if your work is politicalâ€”this should be sincere, but don't be shy about it
- Show yourself being cool, whatever that means to you
- Show that you're engaging with other artists and your local scene

#### Show your work
- Post your finished work, and make it look good
- Show evidence of your practice
    - Reading stuff? Exploring materials? Visiting galleries? Post it
    - **Document your process**. This is why we're doing this now.

#### Promote your events
- If you have a show, you should have multiple posts / stories letting me know about it.


#### Post Regularly
- The three categories all need to be balanced
- Be consistent, ie every week or two you should post
- Lift each other up. Like and comment on your cohort.
