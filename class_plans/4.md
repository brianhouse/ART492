You all have been to the Festival of Scholars in the past, I have not had the opportunity thanks to the pandemic and parental leave.

Present your work at festival of scholars. The format depends on how many of you are interested in participating. If it's a large group, I think we'll do a kind of round-table discussion of the themes of the work. If it's just a few, it will be individual presentations.

also the performative option.

write me an email if you are interested by the end of the week.
