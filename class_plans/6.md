- Haley: did you covert the PDF to tiff, or export tiff directly?
/
- I'm turning the postcard in to PubCom
- If you didnt turn in your name I'm assuming it is just first and last.
- Check in on bios and CVs:
    - Some of you I didn't give a grade, which means I need some somewhat substantial revisions. I'm not giving a deadline for that, just sometime before the end of the semester. we'll refine the exhibition statement now, but the rest will go up with your websites.
    - Others I graded, but left comments. Please incorporate those comments, even if it's not going to matter for your grade.
    - with the CV, a lot of you filled out the template as though it was a google survey. change the headings and format it, personalize it. That level of graphic design actually will make a difference. Definitely do not have n/a under a heading. This is a really important documentâ€”after you graduate and try to apply to something, you'll need it
- How are we with meetings with advisors?
- next week we're starting with curatorial reviews
    - first thing on that is scheduling: please respond to my email now so we can get these on the calendar.
    - second thing is that for that review, you need to know what you want to put in the exhibition

--> and that really should be what the discussion is about tonight. scale, number of pieces, final themes.
