## Course Description
ART 492 is the second half of the capstone series in studio art for senior art majors. Through a series of critiques, discussions, and reviews with peers, faculty, and advisors, the course supports the development of students' thesis work in preparation for the senior art exhibition at Lewis & Clark's Hoffman Gallery. The course also addresses professional development and cultivating a sustainable art practice beyond graduation. This includes documenting work, developing an online portfolio, and planning to apply for internships, grants, residencies, and graduate school.


#### Objectives:
- Complete a body of work that reflects a clearly articulated proposed idea and respond with critical reflection and growth to criticism and discussion by peers, instructors, and visiting artists
- Respond constructively and critically to your own work and the work of peers in an oral and written form
- Evaluate and discuss the role of your art practice as it pertains to a broader contemporary art context
- Expand upon professional art career development and presentation skills
- Be prepared to pursue a rigorous and professional art practice



## Studio Art Thesis
Upon the completion of the semester, you are required to have finalized thesis artwork and accompanying professional materials which you will submit to the Department of Art and Art History for the senior thesis project archives.

Work for this class will be self-directed—**you are expected to independently develop your thesis throughout the semester without specific assignments or prompts**. You should have substantive new material to be evaluated on an ongoing basis inside and outside of class meetings. This is a 4-credit course: 12 hours a week including class time means (at least) 9 hours of studio time outside of class every week!

You will meet with the studio area heads of your declared focus to discuss your progress and address specific material needs. Technical concerns in any medium should be addressed by meeting with full-time studio faculty in specific disciplines. If you are working in a medium outside of the capabilities of the department’s facilities, it is your responsibility to develop the work with an outside mentor approved by a faculty advisor.

Conceptual development is critical to the thesis, and you are expected to cultivate fluency in critical analysis and theory as pertaining to the intent and content of your work.


### Hoffman Gallery Exhibition
The core component of your thesis work is participation in the Senior Exhibition at the Hoffman Gallery. The requirements for the exhibition are listed in the [Exhibition Contract](contract.md). Read this document carefully and honor all deadlines and procedures detailed. Failure to meet these deadlines or follow these procedures will mean that your work is not included in the exhibition.

Visiting external critics will view the exhibition and recommend exemplary students for additional opportunities. Additionally, you will document your work while it is installed in order to complete the professional development deliverables for this course.

All students will contribute to the production, promotion, and documentation of the exhibition as needed.


### Professional Materials
In addition to the requirements for the exhibition as explained in the Exhibition Contract, all students will produce the following professional materials:
- Artist bio
- Artist statement
- Artist CV
- Print portfolio
- Portfolio website
- Artist talk
- Contacts mailing list
- Active Instagram account
- Professional plan and application materials

Your portfolio will be included in your submission to the Department archives, and the materials as a whole will prepare you to pursue opportunities after graduation.


### The Festival of Scholars
The Festival of Scholars is a campus-wide celebration of student work. It is an opportunity to discuss research, to exhibit, perform, or appreciate art, and to cross disciplinary boundaries. The festival will be held on Friday, April 8, 2022, which coincides with the exhibition opening. Several students will be nominated by the Department to participate in the festival by presenting their theses in the Hoffman Gallery.


## Evaluation

You will receive qualitative feedback on your work from the professor and your peers throughout the semester, and you are expected to be dedicated to developing your practice in response. You are also expected to be a full member of the class community by being a thoughtful and enthusiastic participant in critique and a generous contributor to the production of the exhibition. You will receive a midterm and a final grade that reflect these efforts. Students will receive individual feedback at midterm—please make a meeting at any point to check in if you are concerned about your progress. This is the capstone class of your major, so prioritize your time accordingly.


### Attendance
Students are required to be prepared for and attend all scheduled critiques. If two scheduled classes are missed, the student will receive a full grade reduction. If the equivalent of three conferences are missed, the student will fail the course and will be eligible for program termination review. If a student knows they are going to miss a critique, work must be presented the week prior. Two late unexcused arrivals at the beginning of class and/or at break are equivalent to one unexcused absence. Exceptions will be made for COVID-related circumstances.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aesthetic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College's 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. While learning from and incorporating aspects of other artwork is a natural part of artistic practice, you must demonstrate understanding and intentionality in your work, and you may not present others' ideas as your own. Always credit your inspirations and be confident in your original concepts.

### Settler Responsibility
The Fields Art Center is built on land belonging to the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River, and we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. Furthermore, we are at an institution named after white colonizers in a city with a racist history. As artists working in this context, we must be aware of and resist the many ways the structures of which we are a part capitalize upon and perpetuate violence toward marginalized people.

### COVID Health and Safety Expectations
The College’s health and safety guidelines are applied in all settings across campus and comply with county guidelines. We each share responsibility to keep our community healthy by adhering to the following expectations:
-  **Wear a face covering when inside**, even when physical distancing can be maintained, and outside when physical distancing cannot be maintained.
-  **Stay at home if you have any of the following COVID symptoms**, including cough, fever or chills, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nasal congestion, or runny nose.

The Art Department reserves the right to ask you to leave the studios if you exhibit symptoms. If you are present in the studios without a mask, we will remind you to put on a mask immediately or leave class. If necessary, masks may be removed for a short duration for drinking, but please minimize these temporary removals and do not consume food during class time.

If you are experiencing COVID symptoms DO NOT come to campus. Information on COVID symptoms can be found on the [LC Health and Safety Expectations webpage](https://www.lclark.edu/news/covid-19-response/) and on the [CDC webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).
