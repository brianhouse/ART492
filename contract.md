# Senior Exhibition Contract

## Introduction

The Senior Exhibition is the culmination of your creative practice during your senior year at Lewis & Clark. The Department of Art and Art History, the Dean's office, and the College as a whole are invested in its success. By signing this document, you are entering into an agreement with Department that you will be responsible for fulfilling the requirements for each item as indicated below. Failure to adhere to the requirements in this contract will mean that your work will not be included in the exhibition.

**Please save this contract and refer to it throughout the semester.**

## 1. Exhibition Announcement

The design for the front of the exhibition announcement is a collaboration between the senior studio art majors, Publications (a department in the office of Institutional Advancement), and the Art 492 faculty. It is a standard full color 6 x 8.5 inch card. The artwork for the exhibition announcement must be designed and approved by all seniors no later than **Friday, February 11th**.

Prior to this date, a list of the names of all participants written exactly as they will appear throughout the exhibition materials must be finalized. Please consider this carefully. The Art 492 faculty will provide the front design and exhibition details to Publications for printing and mailing to approximately 3,500 addresses.

You will receive 50 exhibition announcements for your own use.


## 2. Curatorial Review

During the week of **February 21th—25th** there will be a curatorial review of the work you would like to have considered for inclusion in the exhibition. The curatorial review panel will be made up of your area advisor and the ART 492 faculty. Your work should be finished prior to the curatorial review, and you should be prepared to discuss how it will be presented in the gallery. Your professor and area advisor will make the final selection of the pieces that will go into the exhibition and the parameters of the presentation based on what you propose. At this time, you will need to commit to final dimensions for each of the artworks included in the show. Special installation requirements and requests will be noted and you may be asked to work with an installation tech to work out any potential installation issues.  


## 3. Catalog Materials

By **Friday, March 4th** you will need to provide the Art 492 faculty member with a finalized catalog materials. Failure to meet this deadline will result in not being represented in the exhibition brochure. You will not have the opportunity to change this information after the due date.

#### Exhibition statement
The exhibition statement is a single 150-300 word statement that summarizes your philosophy, inspiration, and/or working methods for the artwork(s) that you are exhibiting. This must be a final, edited statement that has been reviewed and approved by your advisor and the Art 492 faculty member. No one other than you and your advisors will make edits or corrections to your statement once it has been submitted. If you choose to use non-Western characters or formatting other than italics, please give the final publication submitter explicit instructions.

#### Object list
The object list is the final list of works that you will include in the exhibition. Each artwork must be identified as follows:

- Name of the artist
- Date
- Title
- Medium
- Dimension (Height x Width x Depth) in inches

Please be sure that you follow this format and pay particular attention to dimensions, which provide orientation information about your artwork. The installer may go by this document when installing the show.

#### List of sale and insurance values
Insurance values and sales prices (which may be different) for each work are to be given to the Art Department administrator. The administrator will develop a notebook listing your artwork and sales prices, if applicable, and keep track of sales (do not place “red dots” on your labels). You are not required to sell your work, and if you are, there is no guarantee that there will be an interested buyer. Note that the Hoffman Gallery is not a commercial gallery, and will not become involved in any way with commercial transactions—all sales are managed between student and buyer.

#### Photograph
The exhibition brochure requires a digital photograph (300 ppi) of one artwork from each student that will be exhibited in the show. Bear in mind that the reproduction will be quite small, so if the artwork is large, a detail shot may be appropriate. Submit your photograph with your name and the title of the piece for the caption.


## 4. Installation

#### Preparation
Please make sure that the artwork you deliver to the Hoffman Gallery for installation is adequately prepared. You should work with your advisor to understand clearly how to hang or display your work. You should have had the experience of actually installing this artwork yourself, at some other location, to make sure that your solutions are workable. Be aware that if you have chosen non-traditional presentation methods, you may be asked to work directly with an installation tech to work out any installation issues **before** you deliver your artwork to the Hoffman Gallery.

#### Custom work
Special arrangements must be made for work that is not in a traditional 2D or 3D format and which requires work by the artist in the gallery space (aka installations). Students who wish to do an installation will have access to the Hoffman Gallery on **Wednesday, April 6th**. All  installations must be completed on this day. Any student working on an installation will be required to provide their own labor, tools, and materials for the installation of their piece, and will be required to follow standard security procedures. The Art 492 faculty member will give permission to Campus Safety for the student and any assistants to enter the Gallery—only the names given to Campus Safety will be allowed entrance into the Hoffman Gallery.

#### Delivery
All artwork is due in the Hoffman Gallery on **Tuesday, April 5th between 10am–4pm**. Artwork will not be accepted after this time. **No exceptions**. The consequence for not delivering your artwork on the specified date and time is that your work will not be included in the Senior Exhibition.

#### Installation
Staff will lay out the exhibition and install the artwork from **Tuesday, April 5th through Friday, April 8th**. The layout of the exhibition is the decision of the Art 492 faculty as informed by the curatorial review and cannot be altered at this time. Do not alter the installation or move labels.

Please be aware that the Hoffman Gallery and the faculty/staff of the Department of Art and Art History are not responsible for damage to your work during the installation process that is intrinsic to the risks of handling artwork.


## 5. Opening

All students will attend the opening on **Friday, April 8th** and will collectively be responsible for promoting the exhibition prior to this date and through the duration of the show.


## 6. Deinstall

You **must** remove your artwork from the gallery on **Monday, May 9th, 10am–4pm**. You cannot remove your artwork before this time, as that would compromise the integrity of the exhibition as a whole before it has closed. Any artwork that is left in the gallery after this time will be disposed of.


## Agreement

This document represents the anticipated schedule of the Senior Exhibition at the Hoffman Gallery. In event of uncontrollable circumstances due to COVID-19, natural disasters, political unrest, or other disturbances, a good-faith effort will be made by the College, the Department of Art and Art History, and the students in the exhibition to alter these plans as necessary to produce the exhibition or a reasonable alternative presentation of student work.

**By signing this contract, you are indicating that you understand all of the policies and procedures pertinent to the privilege of exhibiting your artwork in the Senior Exhibition, and that you accept any consequences for not adhering to the above stated deadlines and requirements.**
