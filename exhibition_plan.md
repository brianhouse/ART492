# EXHIBITION PLAN

## Questions

- D-rings for paintings
- Magnets and nails for prints  --> need to get magnets

installing early:
- kess, elana, jesse + maybe lindsey

--> curtain and grow lights for jesse
--> hanging curtain for Elana

Students should provide a schematic of how they want the work laid out and the amount of spacing between each piece, keeping in mind other students and their layouts as well.  If the works cover a lot of space like a grouping of things, some high, some low, they might want to place a piece of blue tape where they want those pieces on the wall.  I will decide on the overall height of things.
